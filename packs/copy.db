They deal no damage on impact, but explode when their fuse determines it (at the end of the userâ€˜s turn, usually, see fuses below). A bomb that is thrown beyond optimal range provides advantage to saving throws to half damage. If you target a creature with the bomb as a ranged weapon attack and succeed on the attack roll, they do not get to roll to halve damage, and suffer the full damage. The creatures in the blast radius are still entitled saving throws as normal. If throwing a bomb on a target, the attack roll is the malfunction roll test, otherwise you must roll for malfunction as a separate d20 roll.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Wc5e - Core p. 260","quantity":1,"weight":2,"price":800,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"uncommon","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":20,"width":null,"units":"ft","type":"sphere"},"range":{"value":30,"long":60,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"rwak","attackBonus":"0","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[["4d6",""]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"dex"},"armor":{"value":10},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"weaponType":"simpleR","baseItem":"","properties":{"ada":false,"amm":false,"fin":false,"fir":false,"foc":false,"hvy":false,"lgt":true,"lod":false,"mgc":false,"rch":false,"rel":false,"ret":false,"sil":false,"spc":false,"thr":true,"two":false,"ver":false},"proficient":true},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"BonBLPHtXp9sRrbq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.y1NlXT6iFwtHgj15"}},"_id":"niSHU21DD3DwBd1m"}
