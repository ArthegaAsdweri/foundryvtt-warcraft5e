{"_id":"URtICjZp9BRWdVlL","name":"Alchemy","permission":{"default":0},"type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"When starting with this class, you have proficiency with Alchemist‘s Supplies and can use them\nwith uncanny skill. You can create alchemical mixtures from any spell that belongs to the alchemist\nspell list, so long as you have the alchemical formula. This does not allow you to cast spells, only to\nknow them enough to create potions. Each level in the alchemist class provides you with 1 caster\nlevel to access alchemical formulae, as appropriate to the alchemist spell list.\nCantrips\nAt 1st level, you know a number of cantrips equal to your proficiency bonus. As normal for\nalchemist spells, you cannot cast them, but can turn them into potions. Cantrips do not require a\nformula book, and are always memorized.\nConjuring and Binding\nAn alchemist can conjure and bind aberrations, constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, and undead,\nas well homunculi creatures (creatures with the homunculus template).\nThis is usually done by crafting miniature versions and preparing them in potions or globes of\nalchemical mixtures.\nPreparing and Casting Spells\nEach alchemist level provides you with one caster level in the alchemist class (minimum 1). You\nfollow the normal progression to unlock spell levels (see the table under the Mana section). You\nmay not prepare spells, but can brew them into potions, so long as you have your formulae book or\nhave memorized the formula.\nWhen you level up, you can exchange a spell known with another you qualify for. You cannot\notherwise change your alchemist spells other than by leveling up and exchanging them, or by\ntraining under another alchemist, fiend, celestial, or undead creature (see tutorship under magic).\nSpellcasting Ability\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your alchemist spells and abilities, since your powers draw\nupon your scientific prowess. You use your Intelligence modifier whenever a spell refers to your\nspellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw\nDC for an alchemist effect you create and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\nSpellbook – Formula Book\nAt 1st level, your formula book contains four 1st-level alchemist spells of your choice. When you\nlevel up, you gain 2 additional alchemist spells of your choice. You may also acquire new spells by\n\nresearch, tutelage, or by deriving formulae from the spellbooks and scrolls of spellcasters who have\nspell versions of the formulae on your spell list.\nYour formula book is effectively your spellbook, and you may add spells by studying with it and\nreplicating experiments found in other formula books.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 34","activation":{"type":"bonus","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"units":null,"type":"self"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"self"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":"","type":""},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"value":"","scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Alchemist 1","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/violet_10.jpg","effects":[]}
