You regain 1d6 temporary hit points at the beginning of your turn every round, up to the initial amount granted by the spell.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, you gain resistance to all types of damage, as well as immunity to cold damage. Damage is applied before being counted against the temporary hit points.</p>\n<p>If the block manages to absorb all damage from an effect, you are protected against any secondary effects (as if immune).</p>\n<p>While encased in ice and concentrating, you are incapacitated.</p>\n<p>When the ice is destroyed or when you cease channeling, you may cast any spell as a bonus action or a reaction (so long as its normal casting time is 1 action or quicker).</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened.</strong> When heightened, the temporary hit points increase by 2d6 per every spell level above 4th.</p>",
