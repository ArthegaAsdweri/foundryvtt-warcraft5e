If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before taking this bonus action, you either gain a +5 bonus to the attack‘s damage roll (if you chose to make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up to 10 feet away from you (if you chose to shove and you succeed).</li>\n<li><em>Epic:</em> If possessing all set pieces, whenever you suffer a critical hit, it turns into a normal hit. You still gain the haste effect (as the bonus at Uncommon quality). You also gain the Aggressive talent if you don't already have it. If you do, you can gain one talent of your choice so long you wear the armor.</li>\n</ul>",
