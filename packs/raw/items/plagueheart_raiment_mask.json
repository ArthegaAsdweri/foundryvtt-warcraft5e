         "value": "<p><em>requires attunement</em></p>\n<p>Originally designed by Burning Legion mad scientists, this colorful set is known to be worn by agents of the Legion who deal with biological and chemical warfare, as well as living members of the Cult of the Damned that need protection from the Scourge‘s plague. While designed as protective gear, as a result of its origins, the gear collects and stores plagues within itself, offering these plagues as an added level of defense.</p>\n<p>This unusual, chaotic-looking armor features patterns of black, orange, yellow, and bright green. Curved spines protrude from the shoulders, and the wearer‘s face is obscured by a strange, bug-eyed mask.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Uncommon:</em> If possessing one set piece, your spells that requires you to make an attack roll (including sigil spells) have their ranges doubled.</li>\n<li><em>Rare:</em> If possessing two to three set pieces, and can add the necrotic aura spell to your spell list, so long as you wear the armor.</li>\n<li><em>Epic:</em> If possessing all set pieces, you have the constant effects of darkvision and demon skin (3rd-level; or 9 temporary hit points) spells. You also no longer need to breathe. The temporary hit points from demon skin replenish upon a short rest.</li>\n</ul>",
