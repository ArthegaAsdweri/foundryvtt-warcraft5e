         "value": "<p><em>requires attunement</em></p>\n<p>If the sword isn't bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard or 1 hour after awakening from a rest of any kind (if attuned), its wielder must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder takes 3d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the Lich King (either via the spirit of Ner‘Zhul or by the blade‘s own consciousness which serves it), as if by the dominate spell. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met, and the spell‘s demand is usually either to spill innocent blood or move the wielder a step closer to being aligned with the Lich King‘s will.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Soul Stealer:</em> The sword traps the souls of the dead. You gain the Blood Death Knight‘s Blood Strike ability. If this strike reduces the target to 0 hit points, it also steals the soul of the target, and retains it in the blade (as the essence seal spell heightened to level 10, or CR 20). The sword can contain up to 200 total CR in the blade. You have advantage to any roll to keep the souls imprisoned in the sword.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While attuned to the artifact, any necromancy or abjuration spell you cast is treated as heightened by one level (up to 9th level), and you gain advantage to all Charisma rolls to deal with undead.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Spells:</em> While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (saving throw 18) from it: dominate undead (level 5), death coil (level 5), or finger of death. Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next midnight. You can also cast speak with dead at will on any corpse or use the spell to speak to any soul trapped in the blade.</li>\n<li><em>Telepathic Speech:</em> While the sword is on your person, you have a telepathic bond with the Lich King, and he is able to target you for any enchantment or necromancy spells (such as dominate person, possession, or conjure undead). If you are the Lich King, your telepathic bond extends to anyone who willingly serves you (including enslaved and animated undead).</li>\n<li><em>Sentience:</em> Frostmourne is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Spirit of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</li>\n<li><em>Personality:</em> The sword's purpose is to serve the Lich King wholly and fully. Killing the enemies of the scourge (members of the Alliance or Horde, followers of the Holy Light, and the Burning Legion if the Lich King wills it), serving the Cult of the Damned, and slaying servants of good all help fulfill this goal.</li>\n<li><em>Destroying the Sword:</em> The sword is destroyed should the Lich King himself be destroyed by fel or holy magic, and if it is targeted with a wish spell and a Charisma check contested with the Charisma of the sword.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The sword must be within 30 feet of the creature, or the spell fails. If the sword wins the contest, nothing happens, and the spell is wasted. If the sword loses the contest, it is destroyed.</p>\n<p>Frostmourne is a powerful blade crafted by demons on the orders of Archimonde, bound with Ner‘Zhul‘s spirit into a shard of ice, and then hurled as a comet onto the highest peak of Icecrown, Azeroth‘s Roof of the World. Its greatest (and only) wielder was Prince Arthas, now known as the Lich King after his mental union with Ner‘Zhul. Frostmourne, as much as the Lich King, is the ruler of Northrend.</p>\n<p>This blue-gray runeblade has a steel skull fixed into the guard, and a tough leather grip, and the runes across the width of the sword give hints of the thousands of tortured souls imprisoned in the wicked soul-stealing blade. The relic of the master of the dead, it holds great power over them.</p>\n<p>This greatsword can be wielded as a magical greatsword that grants a +3 to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead. </p>",
