         "value": "<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">While attuned to the weapon, any necromancy or abjuration spell you cast is treated as heightened by one level (up to 9th level), and you gain advantage to all Charisma rolls to deal with undead.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Spells:</em> While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (saving throw 18) from it: dominate undead (level 5), death coil (level 5), or finger of death. Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next midnight. You can also cast speak with dead at will on any corpse or use the spell to speak to any soul trapped in the blade.</li>\n<li><em>Sentience:</em> Frostmourne is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Spirit of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The shards of a destroyed Frostmourne can be used to forge Shadowmourne. Shadowmourne can take the form of a greatsword, longsword, greathammer, or greataxe. Its rarity decreases to Legendary (and thus can be destroyed without special conditions), its personality changes to follow the crafter‘s, and loses the following features: Telepathic Speech and Soul Stealer, but retains all other features (bonus to attack and damage, spells, sentience, and magical weapon status).</p>\n<p>This weapon can be wielded as a magical weapon that grants a +3 to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead. </p>",
