         "value": "<p><em>requires attunement</em></p>\n<p>Created in Moonglade by the druids of the Cenarion Circle, the Cenarion raiment is worn by some of its most powerful champions as they strive to protect and preserve nature against the unnatural forces that threaten it. The Cenarion raiment features a thick brown leather robe covered in leaves and other symbols of nature – most prominently the sticks and leaves protruding from the wearer‘s shoulders and the antlers resting upon his head.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Uncommon:</em> If possessing one set piece, other creatures don‘t gain advantage on attack rolls against you as a result of being hidden from you.</li>\n<li><em>Rare:</em> If possessing two to three set pieces, you may use the druid‘s wild shape ability as a 2nd level druid. If you already have the wild shape ability, you may use wild shape one more time per rest while wearing the armor, or gain one Blessed Beast feral wild shape option to benefit from one wild shape attempt (chosen once attuned to the armor).</li>\n<li><em>Epic:</em> If possessing all set pieces, the horns of the raiment remain in wild shape, granting you a natural attack that deals 2d6 damage at medium size. Before going into a wild shape, you can designate three spells to be cast upon your horns, which can then either be discharged as per the Spell Strike feat on the target of your natural attack or be cast by touching the target with your horns.</li>\n</ul>",
