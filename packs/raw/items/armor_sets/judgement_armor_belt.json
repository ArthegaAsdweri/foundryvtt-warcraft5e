         "value": "<p><em>requires attunement</em></p>\n<p>Though the Silver Hand is a noble establishment, there comes a time when pleasantries must end and justice must be done. The commanding, faceless aspect of justice and judgement is represented by this armor, which is worn by paladins acting as inquisitors and executioners as they deliver sentence upon the enemy.</p>\n<p>Clad in black, red, and gold, paladins in this full-body armor cut an imposing figure. The armor is a combination of both cloth and leather for easier movement as well as metal plates to protect vital areas. Each piece is ornately detailed with icons and imagery that represent justice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Uncommon:</em> If possessing one set piece, you have a +5 bonus to your passive Spirit (Perception) and passive Intelligence (Investigation) scores.</li>\n<li><em>Rare:</em> If possessing two to three set pieces, you may cast the bless or aid spells up to three times (total of both spells) before the power of the armor is expended, replenishing on the next dawn. If you already have the spell readied, you may instead cast the spell for half normal cost so long as you wear the armor.</li>\n<li><em>Epic:</em>Â If possessing all set pieces, you may cast the arcane armor spell up to three times before the power of the armor is expended, replenishing after the next sundown. The spell is heightened to 6th level and remains for one hour. You also have the constant benefits of the bless and aid (3rd-level; or +10 to your maximum hit points) spells active. The benefit of the aid spell replenishes itself upon a short rest</li>\n</ul>",
