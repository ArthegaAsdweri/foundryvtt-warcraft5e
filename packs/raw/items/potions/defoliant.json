         "value": "<p>This vile liquid has a muddy brown hue and smells of rotten plant life. Contained in one potion flask is enough defoliant to remove plant life from one 5-foot square.</p>\n<p>Light vegetation (anything but trees) dies within 1 hour of exposure, leaving behind scarred and sterile soil (as if blighted). Medium vegetation (anything but massive trees) dies in 2 hours and can be cleared at a rate of 1 hour per 5-foot square.</p>\n<p>Large vegetation (including trees) can usually survive a single dose of defoliant, but the dose scars a 5-foot portion of the tree. If it can scar one-half the tree, the tree rots from within and dies.</p>\n<p>If targeting a plant creature, this potion harms them, reducing the plant creature‘s maximum hit points by 1d4 + 1, halved on a successful Stamina saving throw. This can stack for each application.</p>\n<p>An area affected by defoliant can be cleared by a creature proficient in Alchemist‘s Supplies or an Herbalist‘s Kit. It takes 10 minutes to clear a 5-foot square of defoliant</p>",
