In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon or as a potion (if you are proficient in alchemy). If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 points of holy damage, or takes disadvantage to their next saving throw within 1 hour (your choice).</p>\n<p>Holy water can also free corpses from the Scourgeâ€˜s taint or the Undead Plague if a flask is spent on a creature, preventing it from being reanimated, a discovery made by priestesses of Elune.</p>\n<p>A priest, paladin, or shaman may create holy water (or elemental water if a shaman) without using alchemy by performing a special ritual.</p>\n<p>The ritual takes costs the same in time and materials as a potion (in powdered silver or herbs) and requires the caster to spend mana equal to a 1st level spell.</p>",
