A single given creature can only benefit once from consuming spiritual essence, as consuming it also bestows a shard of the consumed creature's mind to the one who consumed it, usually warping their thoughts and inflicting a minor type of insanity, or causing them to hear hallucinations (usually as if the consumed creature is speaking to them). A creature whose essence is consumed cannot be resurrected, as their soul is obliterated and consumed.</p>\n<p>Demons of great power usually make spiritual essence of particularly tenacious victims to torment them, as the creature is always aware of what is around it, but cannot communicate (is treated as if beyond death, so Speak with Dead cannot function either). This represents artifacts such as the Skull of Gulâ€˜dan.</p>\n<p>For this purpose, if Gul'dan is a 20th level warlock, then his Spirit Essence will yield 71,000 XP (one-fifth of 355,000), usually enough to raise the level of a Demon Hunter.</p>",
