The Robes of the Violet Citadel are suffused with magical powers that support and protect the magi that earned the right to wear them.</p>\n<p>These violet robes are threaded with gold and blue that have high collars, and a black skullcap lined with silver thread (or a wide hood for female magi).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Uncommon: </em>You have advantage on Stamina saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a spell when you take damage.</li>\n<li><em>Rare:</em> If possessing two to three set pieces, you have the constant benefits of mage armor, and you gain 10 temporary hit points at the beginning of every day.</li>\n<li><em>Epic:</em> If possessing all set pieces, you always have the following spells prepared: blizzard (at 3rd level), blink step (at 2nd level) and conjure elemental (choose one elemental, spell is 3rd level). Furthermore, you may cast such spells for no cost. You may cast these spells a total of three times before the spell-weaving capabilities of the robes is exhausted until the next dawn</li>\n</ul>",
