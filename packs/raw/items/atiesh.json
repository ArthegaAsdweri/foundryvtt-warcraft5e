         "value": "<p>Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian is a powerful staff passed down through the line of the Guardians of Tirisfal up until and including Medivh, the last Guardian. It is currently wielded by Medivh's former apprentice, Khadgar. The staff was born from the \"seed of hate\" and grants its wielder \"power unending\". It was passed down by each Guardian of Tirisfal to its successor. This ancient wooden staff has a red sash tied to the head, on which a raven was sculpted.</p>\n<p>If attuned to Atiesh, you may use an action to summon it to your possession, regardless of where it currently is (this acts as a plane shift spell). The staff has 50 charges. It regains 4d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff temporarily loses its powers for until the next dawn and becomes a +1 magical quarterstaff.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Guardian Magic:</em> While attuned to the artifact, any spell you cast is treated as heightened by one level for no cost (up to 9th level), and you gain advantage to all dealings with outsiders, fey, undead, and elementals. Spells. While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: fear (3 charges), gate (9 charges; opens to anywhere, or Karazhan if unspecified), glyph of warding (can heighten to any level; 1 charge per level), phantom steed (3 charges), plane shift (7 charges), polymorph (4 charges), private sanctum (heightened to 6th level; 6 charges)</li>\n<li><em>Watchers:</em> While attuned to this artifact, ravens are drawn to you and often remain close, observing and warning you of any dangers they can notice.</li>\n<li><em>Destroying the Staff:</em> The only way to destroy the staff is either to have it cloven in two by a Titan‘s weapon, affected by the elemental attacks of the four Elemental Lords of Azeroth for one entire day, being consumed by an Old God for one hour, or being targeted with an archdemon‘s wish spell. The destruction of the staff breaks it into fortytwo pieces (the head, tail, and forty shards), and curses it to be bound with a powerful demon (Atiesh, the Hand of Sargeras; an Eredar Warlock). If the staff‘s pieces are ever brought together again, the demon arises to kill the collector and retrieve the staff to his demon master.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This staff can be wielded as a magical quarterstaff that grants a +3 to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>",
