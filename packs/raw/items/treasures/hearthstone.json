Requiring 3 actions (object interaction) to activate, the hearthstone teleports the user to where they last called home. When used, it takes a day to recharge. An adventurer may alter his hearthstone‘s location to any indoor building he has spent more than 24 hours in, which replaces the teleport circle‘s location.</p>\n<p>This stone is given to every adventurer who leaves his city.</p>",
