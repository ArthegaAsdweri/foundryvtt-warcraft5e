If the roll that stems from this ladle is Explosion!, the ladle temporarily becomes a normal ladle for 1d4 days and absorbs the explosion.</p>\n<p>If the ladle is used to apply a matured potion (such as pouring it on the ladle and applying it to yourself or another) while under the effects of another potion, you can choose one of the following results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Un-Wackily Be Stable. Consume the potion and ignore miscibility</li>\n<li>Wackily Experiment. Roll twice for miscibility and choose the better result.</li>\n</ul>",
