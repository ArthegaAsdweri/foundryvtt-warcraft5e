On a mishap, the device‘s internal engine goes haywire, explodes, etc. The device deals its normal damage (if it deals damage) in a 10-foot-sphere centered on the device.

The damage dealt is concussive damage (if it is not of a spell), and the device itself takes the full damage, and does not apply resistance of any type. This may destroy the device.
