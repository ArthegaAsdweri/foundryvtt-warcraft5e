As a skulking murloc prepares to jump out at her, she\ncasually tosses a potion at its chest without glancing at it, causing the\nskin to bubble and blacken with a terrible—the last thing it sees are\nthe forsaken‘s fingers reaching forward to take out its light.\nA gnome reaches down to his box of Alchemist‘s Supplies, picking a\nrare herb and some pinches of sea salt, before tossing them into a\nsmall battle-beaker warmed by a portable burner. With uncanny calm,\nhe weighs the curative mixture, before delivering it to a dying friend,\nrevivifying her.\nLaughing maniacally as he consumes his potion, the troll rushes into the fight, fingertips mutating\ninto razor-sharp claws. As his muscles grow larger, and as his skin hardens, his eyes gleam with the\npromise of pain.\nA goblin mercenary sits on the back of a drugged ogre, tossing explosive potions. Wincing as a\nhuman warrior stabs his giant homunculus, he pulls out a potion from his side pouch and jams it\ndown the ogre‘s throat. The crunch of teeth against glass invigorates the ogre, and, with a burp, it\ntosses its arm forward with great strength, tossing the human away as the alchemist laughs in\ntriumph.\nWhether by careful measuring, self-experimentation, explosive mixtures, or supportive potions, an\nalchemist utilizes their own mix of magic and science, alchemical science, to support and heal\nwounds, decimate enemies, manifest unusual effects, or augment themselves to wade into battle.\nThese lightly armored individuals are experts in creating a variety of special effects, from temporary\nexplosives to elixirs that revive the dead.\nMAGIC AND SCIENCE\nIn the Warcraft universe, alchemy is not merely pseudo-chemistry—it is an art that draws power\nfrom the primal elements of life, not unlike actual magic. An alchemist is a master of the art who\ntakes it leaps and bounds further than their peers, who are limited in their alchemical products to\nmere healing poultices and anti-toxins, reaching heights of reviving the dead or manifesting massive\nexplosives.\n\nThe greatest strength of an alchemist is their versatility. They can themselves adequately but can\nspecialize in being battle-chemists who augment themselves with potions before tearing their\nenemies apart with their own hands. They can choose to focus on the augmentative powers of their\nmixtures, delaying harm and healing wounds, or to debilitate their enemies with negative status\neffects. Damage dealt by an alchemist‘s potions usually focus on concussive or poison damage, but\nthey are also broad in scope, dealing fire or frost or lighting as required of them. The better they\nanticipate their opposition, the better the alchemist can prepare.\nThe success of alchemists relies greatly on the formulae and recipes they have in their formula\nbooks. They gain new formulae as they gain experience, study other formula books, or research\nindependently.\nTHE WEIGHT OF KNOWLEDGE\nAlchemists‘ lives may appear mundane, starting as a sage, independent researcher under a mage\ntower, a plague researcher, or member of a military force‘s supply chain. Other alchemists focus on\ntrade, opening alchemy shops and selling anything from curative mixtures to love potions. Others\nstill have adapted their talents to violence, such as serving in mercenary forces or the military,\nsapping structural defenses and focusing on combat support.\nThe weight of knowledge and the demand for versatile potions calls for even the most sedentary\nalchemists to venture out to investigate strange happenings, support their friends, or answer the call\nto heroism.\nAlchemists are students, researchers, and scientists of the mysterious science of alchemy.\nTo choose to alchemist class is to be more than a dabbler in the art of alchemy—they are utilizers of\nstrange techniques that would empower themselves and their allies, experienced craftspeople who\ncan make potions for fractions of the normal time and cost, and some have even modified their\nbodies to make full use of their skills.\nCreating poisons, potions, special explosives, and empowering substances, alchemists are either\ncuriosities, prized members of society, or reclusive, feared experts in unstable weird sciences.\nAlchemy itself does not fall strictly in one end between science and magic, but is a potent force\nnonetheless.\nAlchemists support soldiers and adventurers, and could easily take to the field themselves, brewing\nand concocting potions, poisons, and poultices to support (or create) allies on the field. Some work\nto support their communities, others attempt to replicate (or surpass) the work of the Scourge's\nnecromancers, and others focus on self-empowering through strange concoctions they imbibe.\nCREATING AN ALCHEMIST\n\nAs you make your alchemist character, consider the origins of their knowledge: were they self-\ntaught, a student of another alchemist, or did they gain this mastery by esoteric means? Alchemy is\n\na difficult discipline—how did you accomplish the challenge to gain your status? Were you\nmotivated by war, fortune, or by something else entirely, such as the lack of magical talent to\nbecome a spellcaster?\nPerhaps you preferred the reliable mundane science of alchemy over the unexpected extraordinary\npower of magic, or took comfort in the fact that you were in demand in an urban setting—there is\nno lack of adventurers who might need your aid as an alchemist if you do not wish to go out and\nadventure. Do you have any peers among alchemists? Do they perceive your approach to science as\ncalm and intellectual, or rash but with great breakthroughs or a dangerous form of meddling with\nlife and death that should not be tolerated? Do you have a special ambition or goal to achieve as an\nalchemist—such as making magic-like effects accessible to the mundane public, providing affordable\nhealing, and counters to common ailments, or are your creations for your own monetary benefit?</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","sta"],"skills":{"number":4,"choices":["acr","ath","ins","inv","med","prc","per","slt","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}
