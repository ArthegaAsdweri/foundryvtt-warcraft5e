## Installation:

This module is based on the default dnd5e System. It basically uses all the default features (drag and drop and stuff) and works exactly how you would expect it to be. However some things got overhauled and some will be. Installation is easy though.

Install the module by adding this manifest URL:

https://github.com/ArthegaAsdweri/foundryvtt-warcraft5e/raw/master/module.json

## Goals
The module aims for a complete implementation of the ruleset with all it's addons (Codex Mandatum, Monster Compendium, ...)
Automation of all possible skills by improving management and usage for foundry VTT.

### Next steps:

- Make races valid items for the character sheet so it automatically updates attributes and stuff
- rework world and lore specific things - (like available languages, ...)
