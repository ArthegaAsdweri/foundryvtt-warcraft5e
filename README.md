This module is based on the default dnd5e System. It basically uses all the default features (drag and drop and stuff) and works exactly how you would expect it to be. However - the templates got overhauled mostly just for aesthetics. 

# Installation:

Install the module by adding this manifest URL:

# Version: 0.0.5

Basic structure of most of the compendium types - some of them installed and working.

# Tasks for now
