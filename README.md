This module is based on the default dnd5e System. It basically uses all the default features (drag and drop and stuff) and works exactly how you would expect it to be. However - the templates got overhauled mostly just for aesthetics. 

# Installation:

Install the module by adding this manifest URL: https://github.com/ArthegaAsdweri/foundryvtt-warcraft5e/raw/master/module.json


Next steps:
- finish all the classes - finished so far: Alchemist, Tinker and Warrior with their class skills and spells
- Make races valid items for the character sheet so it automatically updates attributes and stuff
- rework all the languages and lore specific changes
